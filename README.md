# Mapping the Effects of Tariff Threats on North American Trade

This project analyzes the impact of tariff threats on U.S. imports from Canada and Mexico between November 2024 and January 2025. Using North American Transborder Freight Data from the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics and U.S. state boundary shapefiles from the U.S. Census Bureau, the data was cleaned, normalized, and transformed into shapefiles using Python (pandas, geopandas).

Tools Used:

- Python (pandas, geopandas, os)

- Jupyter Notebook (see Appendix A)

- ArGIS Pro

- Tableau
